Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

Project of [Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata),

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The requirements are to submit:

1. a tidy data set as described below
2. a link to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis, and
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or
   work that is required to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. A README.md is also required to be included in the repo with scripts. This file explains how all
   of the scripts work and how they are connected.
